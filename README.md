Do you remember the fictional bankist app? Here is the bankist website for our application.
This is a kind of marketing website for the same fictional bank.
There are a lot of dynamic effects going on here on this page, and these are for sure some of the most important and commonly used effects that you will see on all website.
Iâ€™m really happy with this nice and beautiful website which looks like a real marketing page of a real company.
Effects that I have used: 
- smooth scrolling animation
- reveal section
- lazy loading images as we scroll to them
- menu bar has become sticky at the top
- menu fade animation
- tapped component
- slider component
- nice popup window (modal window)
So I hope you like this website.
